- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  - Testing is the purpose of this. In this course we used JUnit to test small Java programs. To ensure that my program was both functional and secure I made heavy use of JUnitâ€™s highlighting system and ensured that each of my programs have 90%+ coverage.
- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  - Understanding what a user wants is probably the biggest thing here. Read carefully over the requirements document. Beyond that, I will take those requirements and break each part down into manageable ideas (objects, usually) and then craft methods around what each will need
- How do I approach designing software?
  - I try to approach designing software in an efficient way. To do this I try and keep a few things in mind. First, I do not like to repeat myself in my code. This is important for manageability later. I do this by abstracting any parts of the program that I can. Secondly, I ask questions. If there is something I do not understand, I seek help immediately and do not waste time trying to figure it out alone. Lastly, I test my software. Everything needs to meet specifications and fringe cases need to be handled.
