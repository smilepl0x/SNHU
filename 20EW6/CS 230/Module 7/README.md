GAMING ROOM SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT README

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room client currently had a successful web based game that they wanted to expand to clients that were not browsers. The software needed to be
  able to run on Android and iOS with plans to expand to other platforms as well.

  They also needed a way to have all of the players join a room and a team in order to play with each other. There also needed to be a way for players and administrators to sign into the platform with their respective permissions.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I was successfully able to implement some software development best practices when designing this application. Here one will find demonstrations of the Singleton pattern and the principle of least privilege in regards to types of users.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  The most helpful part of the design document when actually writing the code is definitely the Domain Model as it verbalizes the way the program is to work and includes a UML document to help visualize how the application is to be organized.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  My "Recommendations" section needs some work as it's a little bit soft in it's pitch for a system to implement. There are a lot of "would" and "should" words used and this is not conducive for a document in which the purpose is to guide a client to make the best decision for the company.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  From the client, we knew that the users needed to be on a team and that they needed to be able to have unique names and be on unique teams. We also knew that there would need to be administrative access that differed from normal user access. From all of this we were able to derive a need for a single instance of our game server and user profiles that had different permissions stored on a database of some kind.

  It's important to consider how the users will be using your application because the entire point of the application is that it is made for a user! We want the user to have a good experience when using our software. Also, it will potentially save a lot of time when revising later if the user is considered at the beginning of a project.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  Designing, in regards to this project, took a lot of reaching out to my professor. This software required a lot of tools that I was unfamiliar with (Maven / DropWizard) and this document required skill in conveying a concept to a client that may not be a developer. I was able to gain skills in all of this during the past 8 weeks.

  As I now understand the importance of a software design document, I will be looking for these with my future employer to give me a better idea of the applications I am building.
