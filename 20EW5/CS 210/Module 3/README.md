Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  For this project, our client, Chada Tech was needing a clock to display both 12 and 24 hour time with the ability to program different times.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I was proud of myself for going outside of the standard C++ library and finding alternative solutions to this problem
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  There are several places where I could make enhancements. While my program works, it seems a little convoluted for me and in the future I would like to go back and change this    and make the code simpler.
  
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The 12 hour portion of the clock was the hardest for me. Using the time library, the 24 hour clock was easy enough, but getting my code to not go beyond 12, or display 0 for      12am was challenging
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  During this project, I was really forced to examine my loops closely to ensure they were correct and I feel like I gained a deeper insight on how they work. I also learned a lot  about other libraries that are available. I believe this will help me in the future as well.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Comments, comments, comments. Also I did my best to make this program as modular as I could conceptualize.
